      "content": "HOW TO USE\n\nThis app includes several different tools you can use to achieve Peace Of Mind.\n\n- Daily guided meditations: we suggest you do these twice per day. Once in the morning after you wake up, and once in the evening, usually before dinner time is best.\n\n- Sleep meditations: you can play these on your phone to help you relax and have a peaceful deep sleep.\n\n- Nature sounds and music: as you become more advanced in meditation, you may find you prefer to meditate without a guide. These nature sounds and relaxing music are good options so you can get in the meditative state without anything to distract you.\n\n- Mindset Tracks: these help you to change your perspective and help you cultivate more of a masculine mindset. You can listen to these any time of the day. This is to be done ON TOP of the daily meditations, not as a replacement.\n\nTECHNICAL SETUP\n\n- Phone on airplane mode: We suggest you download all of the tracks while you have internet connection, then when you're using the app you can have your phone on Airplane mode.\n\n- Turn off notifications in Telegram\n\nSUPPORT\n\nIf you get stuck / membership questions, send an email: support@oscarvore.com",
